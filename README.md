Problem Statement: 
Taking three groups of students. In each group, students are studying for different degrees. Our task is to make a model that can help analyze this data.

DataSet: https://github.com/Biswayan-Mehra/DS-for-Social-Good/blob/2833a5684791633c581fd0e9f6468fb95b393c55/StudentsPerformance.csv

Assignment 1 - Data Visualization  and Assignment 2 - Model Building are samples for this project with each having it dataset included and colab file in it's respective repositories.

Here are a few ideas:
1.Predicting exam performance: You can use machine learning algorithms to predict a student's exam performance based on various factors such as their attendance, previous grades, study hours, etc.

2.Identifying factors affecting performance: You can use EDA techniques to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on a student's performance, such as their socio-economic status, family background, gender, etc.

3.Clustering students based on performance: You can use clustering techniques to group students based on their performance in various subjects. This can help identify patterns and relationships between students and their performance.

4.Visualizing performance trends: You can use data visualization techniques to create visualizations of student performance trends over time. This can help identify areas where students are improving or struggling.

5.Recommending study materials: You can use machine learning algorithms to recommend study materials to students based on their learning style, performance history, and other factors.

6.Detecting cheating: You can use statistical techniques to identify instances of cheating in exams, such as when a student's performance is significantly higher than their previous grades or the class average.

7.Predicting student dropout rates: You can use machine learning algorithms to predict which students are at risk of dropping out of school based on various factors such as their academic performance, attendance, and socio-economic background.
